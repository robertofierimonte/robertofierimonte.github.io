Welcome! I am a Machine Learning Engineer based in London, who is passionate about building end-to-end ML solutions on the cloud. I am currently working at [BT](https://www.bt.com/), where I am responsible for the delivery of Data Science and ML projects for the Networks and Openreach business units. Prior to BT, I worked at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk), [Bumble](https://bumble.com/), and [Avanade](https://www.avanade.com/en-gb/).

I earned my M.Res. in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Prof. David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php), with a thesis on Variational Autoencoders for Time Series generation and forecasting. Prior to moving to the UK I graduated from the M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from [Sapienza Univesity of Rome](http://en.uniroma1.it/) under the supervision of [Prof. Massimo Panella](https://sites.google.com/uniroma1.it/massimopanella-eng/home), with whom I co-authored a number of research papers on distributed ML methods. All my publications can be found in the [publications](publications) section.
