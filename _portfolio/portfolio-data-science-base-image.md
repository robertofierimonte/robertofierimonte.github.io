This project aims to provide a reproducible environment against which to run Data Science tests and workflows in GCP. It includes python 3.9, Docker, and the GCP SDK. I tend to use this image as the base image when running CI/CD pipelines for ML / DS models on GCP. 

The source code for the project can be found in the [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/robertofierimonte/data-science-base-image).
