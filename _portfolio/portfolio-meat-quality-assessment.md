The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether meat is fresh or spoiled and can therefore be consumed.

The dataset used in this project was originally built for this [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8946388) and subsequently made available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowww/meat-quality-assessment-based-on-deep-learning).

The source code for the project can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/robertofierimonte/meat-quality-assessment).
